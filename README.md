```javascript
const myFavoriteProgrammingLaguage = 'javascript';
```
(i also like python, but not as much)

most of my repos are either empty or dead.

i've also made some npm packages, including: hashfry [gh](https://github.com/finngreiter/hashfry) [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/hashfry), a simple hashing library, and hyprlink [gh](https://github.com/finngreiter/hyprlink) [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/hyprlink), for recognizing links in plain text.
