```javascript
let myFavoriteProgrammingLaguage = 'javascript';
```
(i also like python, but not as much)

most of my repos are dead or have never been commited to.

i've also made some npm packages, including: [hashfry](https://npmjs.com/package/hashfry), a simple hashing library, and [hyprlink](https://npmjs.com/package/hyprlink), for recognizing links in plain text.
